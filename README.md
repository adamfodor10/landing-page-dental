# Landing Page for Dental Business
In this project I created a dummy landing page for Radiant Smile Dental Clinic (dummy Dental Business).
The graphic design was provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) (see images folder).
I used Flexbox layout extensively to create the CSS design of the website.
